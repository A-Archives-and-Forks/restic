Bugfix: Improve handling of download retries in `check` command

In very rare cases, the `check` command could unnecessarily report a
repository damage if the backend returns incomplete, corrupted data on
the first download try which is resolved by a download retry.

Now, only the check result of the last download attempt is reported as
intended.
