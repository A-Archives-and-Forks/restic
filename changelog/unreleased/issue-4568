Bugfix: Prevent `forget --keep-tags invalid` from deleting all snapshots

Running `forget --keep-tags invalid`, where the tag `invalid` does not
exist in the repository, would remove all snapshots. This is especially
problematic if the tag name contains a typo.

The `forget` command now fails with an error if all snapshots in a snapshot
group would be deleted. This prevents the above example from deleting all
snapshots.
